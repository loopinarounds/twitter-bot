# twitter-bot

This is a simple script that makes use of the free-to-access Twitter API. The script in app.js fetches the 10 most recent tweets from a chosen hastag. Once these tweets are successfuly scraped, it adds each of the tweets to your favourites and logs the direct links of the tweets to the console.

## How to Use

You must first sign up for the twitter API using this link: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard. Once you have signed up and applied for permission to use the API, you can get all of the access tokens and API tokens needed to finish the config.js file. You can then edit the app.js file to fetch from any hashtag you wish by editing the 'params' object.
